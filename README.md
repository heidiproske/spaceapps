The WhereOnEarth project contains the code written for Astrid's Landing, a quiz game that shows the user a satellite image of a city and prompts the user to choose one of 4 answers.

If an incorrect answer is given, the incorrect answer will be marked as red. If the correct answer is given, the Wikipedia page for that city will be shown.

This project was submitted to the 2014 International Space Apps Challenge at the Atlanta location for one of the *easy* challenges from the **Earth Watch** theme:

>Create a game or app that displays satellite images of places around the world and asks users to guess where and what they are.

I worked with Chad Marcum on this project. All code was done by me.
